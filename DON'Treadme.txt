Please read this in RAW.
This is but a fan project. 
I mostly use scratch, so this is a HUUUUUGE learning curve for me.
As stated earlier, this is new to me, so don't expect AM2R for MMXtreme 2 here.
Thank you very much for just visiting this repository and taking some time to read this file.
Cheers, Dallas, the creator of this repository.
